title: Address to a Haggis
---

Fair fa' your honest, sonsie face,  
Great chieftain o' the puddin'-race!  
Aboon them a' ye tak yer place,  
Painch, tripe, or thairm:  
Weel are ye wordy o' a grace  
As lang's my airm.

The groaning trencher there ye fill,  
Your hurdies like a distant hill,  
Your pin wad help to mend a mill  
In time o need,  
While thro your pores the dews distil  
Like amber bead.

His knife see rustic Labour dicht,  
An cut you up wi ready slicht,  
Trenching your gushing entrails bricht,  
Like onie ditch;  
And then, Oh what a glorious sicht,  
Warm-reekin, rich!

Then, horn for horn, they stretch an strive:  
Deil tak the hindmaist, on they drive,  
Till a' their weel-swall'd kytes belyve  
Are bent like drums;  
Then auld Guidman, maist like to rive,  
'Bethankit' hums.

Is there that ower his French ragout,  
Or olio that wad staw a sow,  
Or fricassee wad mak her spew  
Wi perfect scunner,  
Looks down wi' sneering, scornfu view  
On sic a dinner?

Poor devil! see him owre his trash,  
As feckless as a wither'd rash,  
His spindle shank a guid whip-lash,  
His nieve a nit:  
Thro bluidy flood or field to dash,  
O how unfit!

But mark the Rustic, haggis-fed,  
The trembling earth resounds his tread,  
Clap in his wallie nieve a blade,  
He'll make it whissle;  
An legs an arms, an heads will sned,  
Like taps o' thrissle.

Ye Pow'rs wha mak mankind your care,  
And dish them out their bill o' fare,  
Auld Scotland wants nae skinking ware  
That jaups in luggies;  
But, if ye wish her gratefu prayer,  
Gie her a Haggis!
