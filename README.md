# Minissg

Minissg (pronounce it as "missing" ðŸ˜„) is a minimum-sized,
configurable, and zero-JS static site generator, provided as a Vite
plugin.

Unlike fully-featured frameworks, it aims to bring the bare
functionality of JS and Vite, including its extensibility and
performance, into static site generation.
Minissg is carefully designed just as a Vite plugin, not as a
framework, so that it does not hide anything in JS and Vite from the
users.
With Minissg, any decision and convention for static site generation
are up to you; for example, you can write your static webpages with
any combination of your favorite JS technologies in exchange of a
little effort to write some JS code and some configurations in
`vite.config.js`.

See [packages/vite-plugin-minissg/README.md] for details.
